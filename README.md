# Mergify

Mergify is a tool to merge changes from a branch one commit at a time.  This
is most useful when merging changes to a highly diverged fork of a project.

```
usage:
    mergify start [<options>] <branch>
    mergify abort
    mergify autoadd
    mergify commit
    mergify continue
    mergify resolve
    mergify skip
    mergify show
    mergify status
```

## Commands
 * start

	Begin mergin *branch* to the current branch.  All changes since the
	common parent will be merged one change at a time.  If merge
	fails, mergify exits to allow the user to correct the merge.

	Options:

	-c <list-of-hashes>

	Stop when any of the hashes in the space-separated list of hashes has
	been merged.

	-p <pause-expression>

	Paths to files modified by the commit are matched against the
	expression.  If it matches, mergify stops before committing the merged
	commit.

	-s

	Begin the merge, but end after the first commit.

 * abort

	Abandon the current merge process.  Previously merged changes are not
        reverted, but a revision is provided as a target for git reset.

 * autoadd

	Add changed files that do not contain conflict markers.

	Also delete files that were deleted from this tree in a prior commit
	and changed upstream.

 * commit

	Commit the resolved change and exit.

	Intended to be used when the local tree needs further adaptation
	after the current change is merged.

 * continue

	Commit the resolved change and continue the merging process.

 * resolve

	Open each file requiring resolution in `${EDITOR}` in turn.

	**This interface is lousy and will likey be replaced with
	Subversion style interactive prompts in later revisions.**
 * show

	Show the contents of the commit being merged.

 * skip

	Restore the tree to the previous state and commit the merge.
	This makes makes the merge commit a no-op.

	This is useful when a change conflicts badly and as later
	reverted or if it is one of several commits toward the state in
	the current tree (e.g. when local changes are upstreamed in
	multiple commits.)

 * status

	Show the current merge status.
